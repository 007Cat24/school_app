# School App
Hello everyone!
This is my repo for my project: a simple school app, which will be built in modules that can be added.
It is being created for schools, is free to use and is split into three modules:
### Chat
A basic chat, at start for everyone, later split into groups
### Information
This module provides information: Vacations, lessons etc.
### Planning
This interface is provided to manage tests etc.

The programming language is currently being decided, likely Python or Node.JS .
This will start as a web app.

### Current APIs:
- [ ] Pusher (Chat)
- [ ] SendGrid (Mail)

Feel free to commit and help! :smiley:
